## Project Description

Book Search Engne is an application that allos a user to "google" or search their favorite books. Upon opening the app, the user will be prompted to log into their account, and see books that they saved.

In this project, I replaced a previous RESTful API and integrated a GraphQL API to create a functioning book search engine using the MERN stack.
